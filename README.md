To install nx monorepo using Angular, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js (18.5.0) installed on your machine. You can download it at https://nodejs.org/en/.  

2. Open the terminal and install the Angular CLI  globally using the following commands:


npm install -g @angular/cli


3. Install Nx Globally


npm install --global nx@latest


4. Now you can create Angular and Ionic apps within your nx project using the following commands:


nx generate @nrwl/angular:application my-angular-app


5. To run your apps, use the following commands:

For the Angular app:

nx serve exercises


6. To build your apps for production, use the following commands:

For the Angular app:

$ nx build exercises --prod

7. To test your apps, use the following commands:

For the Angular app:

$ npm run affected:test

## Running the project

    $ npm install
    $ npm run affected:build // (build the libs and apps)
    $ npm run affected:build // Test All Project
    $ npm run test:coverage // Test With Coverage
    $ npm run ci:test:coverage // lint apps and libs
    $ npm run scan:application //  is a feature of the Angular development framework, Nx, that generates a dependency graph between projects in an Nx monorepo.

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test:all` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

    $ npm run affected:test // test all apps
