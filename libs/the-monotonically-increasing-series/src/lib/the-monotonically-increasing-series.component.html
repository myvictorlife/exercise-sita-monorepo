                    Given some function F(index) which returns a monotonically increasing sequence of integers, the following holds true: F(x) >= F(y) for all x > y.
                    Given such a function, write another function which takes a "target" number and finds the index at which the value of F(index) is the closest to the target. Include tests for your code.
